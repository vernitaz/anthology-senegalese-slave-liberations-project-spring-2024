title: "Senegalese Slave Liberations Project"

project-description: "The Senegalese Slave Liberations Project builds on the Slave Voyages Database, which has transformed the study of the trans-Atlantic slave trade by presenting the most comprehensive collection of individual slave trade voyages and the most complete set of evidence of African ports of embarkation and American ports of disembarkation. The Slave Voyages Database, however, tells us virtually nothing about slavery and the slave trade within Africa. The Senegalese Slave Liberations Project provides a crucial counterpart to the Slave Voyages project in presenting evidence of slavery and the slave trade in the Senegambian, Mauritanian, and Malian region of West Africa during the second half of the nineteenth century. Specifically, registers of liberation have survived as records of enslaved people under French colonial authority who sought their freedom. The project team is working to provide unique identifications for each case of liberation, analyze the data, and develop visualizations to support academic research and innovative pedagogy."

# Transcribing Liberation Cases

My Spring Quarter internship with the Senegalese Slave Liberations Project revolved around two main components: expanding the project database of slave liberation records, and enhancing the accessibility and richness of the project website through gathering and creating visual materials. 

For the data entry portion of my internship, I focused on transcribing liberation records from the digitized register of 1058 cases from the year 1882 onto the project's database spreadsheet, recording each liberated individual’s name, age, place of birth, parents’ names, place of liberation within colonial Senegal, date of liberation, authorizing administrator, and, in the case of minors, guardian name and occupation (see Figure 1). Building upon the work of previous interns, I paid particular attention to the familial connections among liberated individuals and identified sibling relations as a new point of interest to be noted alongside parental relations. The main challenge posed by data entry was no doubt deciphering the sometimes illegible, ambiguous, or inconsistent 19th-century French cursive handwriting of the register, but with reference to the document’s index, previous data entry records, and initial assistance from Becca, a former intern, I quickly became comfortable navigating the script. Moreover, the inconsistencies and ambiguities in the script often turned out to be fruitful, offering valuable insights into the orthographic conventions of the time and the challenges that arise from the phonetic conversion of local Senegalese dialects into French.

The Registers of Liberation consist of twenty ledgers containing records of 28,930 liberations that occurred between 1857 and 1903. While the format of data entry evolved through the years, this featured page provides a representative glimpse into the entry system employed by the colonial administration.](data/imgs/Figure 1.png)

# Visualizing Liberation Cases

As a central aim of the Senegalese Slave Liberation Project is to make the primary data on liberation available for scholarly and pedagogical use, another crucial component of my work this quarter involved gathering and creating visualizations to be incorporated into the project’s website. Drawing upon sources such as Giulia Paoletti’s Portrait and Place: Photography in Senegal, 1840–1960, and archives from the photographic department of the Archives nationales d'outre-mer in Aix-en-Provence, I curated a series of photographs and maps of colonial Senegal (see Figures 2 and 3). These images will be used to accompany and enrich the project website, which contains articles on the history of slavery in Senegal as well as broader discussions of freedom and unfreedom in a global context. In addition to sourcing photographs, I worked on converting subsets of the transcribed data into accessible and aesthetically engaging visualizations (see Figure 4). Together, these various visual elements contribute towards the team’s ongoing efforts to enhance the availability and legibility of the Registers of Slave Liberation in Colonial Segal—a rich, sprawling, yet underused primary database—for a wider audience.
