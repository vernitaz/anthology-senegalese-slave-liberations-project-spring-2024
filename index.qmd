project-description: "The project Description contains few lines of description about the project. The description should be succint and give the reader a brief overview of what they could expect in the article. The project description can span from 4-5 lines and it is expected to capture the complete essence of the project. This article page comprises of two sub-articles related to the group. The article 1 focuses on the authoring capabilites of quarto and article 2 focuses on the computational capabilities. This article page is made using Quarto."

# Transcribing and Visualizing Liberation Cases

My Spring Quarter internship with the Senegalese Slave Liberations Project revolved around two main components: expanding the project database of slave liberation records, and enhancing the accessibility and richness of the project website through gathering and creating visual materials. 

For the data entry portion of my internship, I focused on transcribing liberation records from the digitized register of 1058 cases from the year 1882 onto the project's database spreadsheet, recording each liberated individual’s name, age, place of birth, parents’ names, place of liberation within colonial Senegal, date of liberation, authorizing administrator, and, in the case of minors, guardian name and occupation. Building upon the work of previous interns, I paid particular attention to the familial connections among liberated individuals and identified sibling relations as a new point of interest to be noted alongside parental relations. The main challenge posed by data entry was no doubt deciphering the sometimes illegible, ambiguous, or inconsistent 19th-century French cursive handwriting of the register, but with reference to the document’s index, previous data entry records, and initial assistance from Becca, a former intern, I quickly became comfortable navigating the script. Moreover, the inconsistencies and ambiguities in the script often turned out to be fruitful, offering valuable insights into the orthographic conventions of the time and the challenges that arise from the phonetic conversion of local Senegalese dialects into French.

As a central aim of the Senegalese Slave Liberation Project is to make the primary data on liberation available for scholarly and pedagogical use, another crucial component of my work this quarter involved gathering and creating visualizations to be incorporated into the project’s website. Drawing upon sources such as Giulia Paoletti’s Portrait and Place: Photography in Senegal, 1840–1960, and archives from the photographic department of the Archives nationales d'outre-mer in Aix-en-Provence, I curated a series of photographs depicting life in colonial Senegal. These images will be used to accompany and enrich the project website, which contains articles on the history of slavery in Senegal as well as broader discussions of freedom and unfreedom in a global context. In addition to sourcing photographs, I worked on converting subsets of the transcribed data into accessible and aesthetically engaging visualizations. Together, these various visual elements contribute towards the team’s ongoing efforts to enhance the availability and legibility of the Registers of Slave Liberation in Colonial Segal—a rich, sprawling, yet underused primary database—for a wider audience.




## Authoring features of Quarto
In this section, let's see some of the authoring features of Quarto.


### Callouts

Quarto allows different types of callouts to emphasize the content.

::: {.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip with Title
This is an example of a callout with a title.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse
This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.

### Figures
In Quarto, figures can be easily imported using the markdown syntax, given the image is stored in the codebase. You can see the example given below.

Below is a full column image.

### Tables
In Quarto, tables can be easily created using the pipe table markdown syntax. You can see the example given below.

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

### Diagrams
Quarto allows natively the authors to create diagrams using Mermaid and Graphviz. Check the [official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html) for more details.

Below is an example of a Mermaid diagram.
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

### Videos
In Quarto, videos can be embedded from both locally and remote sources such as YouTube and Vimeo.

### Appendices and Footnotes
Quarto allows the authors to create appendices and footnotes easily.

#### Appendix
In Quarto, appendices can be created using the `.appendix` class. The appendix section is placed at the end of the document and is not included in the table of contents.

##### Appendix Example {.appendix}
Here is an example of an appendix.

#### Footnote
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.




# Title of Article 2
:::{.article-author}
Joe Doe
:::

This article focuses on the computational capabilities of Quarto.  


## Visualizations
Quarto allows the users to run Python and R code directly in the page and get their output. This means that cool and interactive visualizations generated using Python or R can be rendered directly in the page. Please ensure that the essential library dependencies are installed to render the visualizations. For example, the following visualization requires `plotly` library which is installed along with the requirements. Whenever you install a new library, don't forget to add it to `requirements.txt`.

Whenever an interactive visualization is added, an equivalent static image alternative should also be added for the Anthology print version. Refer to the code below.

The content below will appear only in the html version.

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
### Interactive Plotly Chart
For a demonstration of a Plotly chart, see @fig-example.

```{python}
#| label: fig-example
#| fig-cap: Example Interactive Plotly Chart
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species",
                 size='petal_length', hover_data=['petal_width'])
fig.show()
```

## Observable
Similar to Python and R code, Quarto is also capable of handling Observable. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/ojs.html) for more details.
