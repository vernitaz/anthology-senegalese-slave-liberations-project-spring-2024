The description should be succint and give the reader a brief overview of what they could expect in the article. The project description can span from 4-5 lines and it is expected to capture the complete essence of the project. This article page comprises of two sub-articles related to the group. The article 1 focuses on the authoring capabilites of quarto and article 2 focuses on the computational capabilities. This article page is made using Quarto."

    "text": "Authoring features of Quarto\n  In this section, let’s see some of the authoring features of Quarto.\n  \n  Callouts\n  Quarto allows different types of callouts to emphasize the content.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Note\n  \n  \n  \n  Note that there are five types of callouts, including: note, warning, important, tip, and caution.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Tip with Title\n  \n  \n  \n  This is an example of a callout with a title.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Expand To Learn About Collapse\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  This is an example of a ‘folded’ caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use collapse=\"true\" to collapse it by default or collapse=\"false\" to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Figures\n  In Quarto, figures can be easily imported using the markdown syntax, given the image is stored in the codebase. You can see the example given below.\n  \n  \n  \n  Maps of French colonies in Senegal and the islands of Mayotte, Nosy-Be and Sainte-Marie-de-Madagascar (modern-day Madagascar), overlaying an indigenous landscape. A chromolithograph card published in 1890, the illustration will be added to the collection of maps currently displayed on the project website.\n  \n  \n  Below is a full column image.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Tables\n  In Quarto, tables can be easily created using the pipe table markdown syntax. You can see the example given below.\n  \n  Demonstration of pipe table syntax\n  \n  \n  Default\n  Left\n  Right\n  Center\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  12\n  12\n  12\n  12\n  \n  \n  123\n  123\n  123\n  123\n  \n  \n  1\n  1\n  1\n  1\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Diagrams\n  Quarto allows natively the authors to create diagrams using Mermaid and Graphviz. Check the official documentation for more details.\n  Below is an example of a Mermaid diagram.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  flowchart LR\n    A[Hard edge] --&gt; B(Round edge)\n    B --&gt; C{Decision}\n    C --&gt; D[Result one]\n    C --&gt; E[Result two]\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Videos\n  In Quarto, videos can be embedded from both locally and remote sources such as YouTube and Vimeo.\n  \n  \n  \n  Appendices and Footnotes\n  Quarto allows the authors to create appendices and footnotes easily.\n  \n  Appendix\n  In Quarto, appendices can be created using the .appendix class. The appendix section is placed at the end of the document and is not included in the table of contents.\n  \n  \n  \n  Footnote\n  Here is a footnote reference,1 and another.2"

    "text": "Visualizations\n  Quarto allows the users to run Python and R code directly in the page and get their output. This means that cool and interactive visualizations generated using Python or R can be rendered directly in the page. Please ensure that the essential library dependencies are installed to render the visualizations. For example, the following visualization requires plotly library which is installed along with the requirements. Whenever you install a new library, don’t forget to add it to requirements.txt.\n  Whenever an interactive visualization is added, an equivalent static image alternative should also be added for the Anthology print version. Refer to the code below.\n  The content below will appear only in the html version.\n  \n  Interactive Plotly Chart\n  For a demonstration of a Plotly chart, see Figure 1.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n                                                  \n  \n  \n  Figure 1: Example Interactive Plotly Chart\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  The content below will appear only in the pdf output but not in the html version."
